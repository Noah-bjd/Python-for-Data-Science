# Training Piscine - Python for Data Science 0 :shipit:

This repository contains my solutions to the **Training Piscine Python for Data Science - 0** exercises.
The goal of this project is to practice the fundamentals of Python programming through a series of progressively challenging exercises.

---

## üìö Project Overview

The Piscine introduces core Python concepts and encourages writing clean, modular, and well-documented code.
It covers topics such as:

* Basic Python syntax and scripts
* Working with different data types
* Functions and error handling
* Command-line arguments
* String and text processing
* Dictionaries and Morse code
* Implementing your own Python functions (e.g., `filter`, `tqdm`)
* Creating standalone programs
* Building and publishing a Python package

---

## üõ†Ô∏è General Rules

* Python version **3.10** is required.
* Global variables are not allowed.
* Code must follow the **PEP8 style guide** (`flake8`).
* All programs must be structured with:

  ```python
  def main():
      # your code here

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```
* Functions must include proper **docstrings**.
* Explicit imports are mandatory (e.g., `import numpy as np` instead of `from numpy import *`).

## üìÇ Exercises

### **Exercise 00 - First Python Script**

Create a script (`Hello.py`) that outputs greetings using different Python data types.

### **Exercise 01 - First Use of a Package**

Format and display the current date and time (`format_ft_time.py`).

### **Exercise 02 - First Function**

Write a function that prints object types and returns `42` (`find_ft_type.py`).

### **Exercise 03 - NULL Not Found**

Detect and display all types of `Null` values (`NULL_not_found.py`).

### **Exercise 04 - Even and Odd**

Check whether a given number is even or odd (`whatis.py`).

### **Exercise 05 - Standalone Program**

Analyze a string and count uppercase, lowercase, digits, spaces, and punctuation (`building.py`).

### **Exercise 06 - Reimplement Filter + Program**

Recreate the `filter()` function (`ft_filter.py`) and build a program that filters words by length (`filterstring.py`).

### **Exercise 07 - Dictionaries SoS**

Convert text into **Morse Code** using dictionaries (`sos.py`).

### **Exercise 08 - Loading...**

Recreate the `tqdm` progress bar (`Loading.py`).

### **Exercise 09 - My First Package**

Create and install your first Python package (`ft_package`).
